## Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

## Project Overview

2)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

3)Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

4)Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more
